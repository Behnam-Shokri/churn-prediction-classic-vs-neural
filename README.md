📊 Project Overview
This repository presents two approaches for predicting customer churn using a bank dataset:

Classical Machine Learning Models:
Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and other traditional algorithms.

Deep Neural Network (DNN):
Implementation of a neural network for improved prediction.

The primary objective is to compare the performance of classical machine learning models with deep learning methods in the context of customer churn prediction.

Note:
This project is developed for educational purposes as part of coursework in Data Science & Machine Learning at the becomexpert.
